Input:
- Results.mat          : Output of FPCAreal_data.m
- vdaxm.txt            : VDAX index time series (same date as the loadings)
- xData.txt            : date time series
- Is.txt               : index for the time series of loadings
- tickdatayear.txt     : tick years

Output: 'It plots the functional components and the corresponding loadings.'
